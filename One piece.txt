formerly one of the Four Emperors ruling over the New World, as the only female member of that group.
She is the matriarch of the very large Charlotte Family, whose many children make up the infrastructure
of her crew. She is also the creator of the unique race of creatures known as Homies, who mainly inhabit
 all of Totto Land, and happily serve her. Big Mom possesses three special homies, Napoleon, Prometheus,
 and Zeus, but unhappy with Zeus' continued failures, Big Mom decided to disown and replace him with a new
 Homie named Hera.

 Perospero is a very tall and slim man with brown eyes, a pointed nose, pink lips, and a very long,
 thick tongue. He is often seen smiling, but on rare occasions, such as when his mother threatened him,
 his smile changes into that of a horrified expression.

  oldest triplet brother of Custard and Angel.He is also one of the Three Sweet Commanders of the
  Big Mom Pirates and serves as Totto Land's Minister of Biscuits (ビスケット大臣, Bisuketto Daijin?),
