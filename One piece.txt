formerly one of the Four Emperors ruling over the New World, as the only female member of that group.
She is the matriarch of the very large Charlotte Family, whose many children make up the infrastructure
of her crew. She is also the creator of the unique race of creatures known as Homies, who mainly inhabit

 and Zeus, but unhappy with Zeus' continued failures, Big Mom decided to disown and replace him with a new
 Homie named Hera.
